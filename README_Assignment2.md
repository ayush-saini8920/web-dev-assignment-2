# 🌐 Web Development Lab Assignment 2  
## Personal Portfolio Website (CSS Core)

### 🧩 Project Description
This is my **Personal Portfolio Website** built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The website contains multiple sections:
- 🧑‍🎓 About Me – A short introduction about myself  
- 💼 Projects – A list of basic web development projects  
- 🧠 Technical Skills – A styled table displaying my skills and levels  
- ✉️ Contact – A simple contact form with input fields  

All the styling is done through an **external CSS file (style.css)**. The webpage follows a **consistent color theme**, uses **Google Fonts**, and applies the **CSS box model** for spacing and layout.

### 🎨 Features Implemented
- External CSS linked to the HTML file  
- Sticky and styled navigation bar
